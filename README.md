# Collab Draw
It is a collaborative drawing application which is a real time whiteboard. 
It is used for instantly sharing and collaborating with your team in real time.
Like a chat application where people create groups, similarly we can create groups here and collaborate with other people for brainstorming, 
discussions and wireframing. It is used to discuss your ideas remotely. It helps to get the best out of your distributed team. If any changes are made in 
a group then it will be reflected to all the other people in that group in realtime and this data of whiteboard is saved in database and can be accessed 
whenever required. Authentication is done for every user before accessing the whiteboard and the user can have a single plank which is a private room 
accessible only to that particular user.
